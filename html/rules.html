                        Higley Assassins is a continuous competition organized by students and for students at Higley. During the game, students organize into teams and play the roles of assassins, targeting other students in attempts to eliminate them. The final team with any players not eliminated are the winners of the game and the prize money.

                        Barring [Variation Weeks], teams are each secretly assigned a target team through Instagram [LINK TO INSTAGRAM PAGE] and their team page on HigleyAssassins.com [LINK] every week. To eliminate a member of their target team, they must get their targets wet using water in any method they choose, then give video evidence to the directors through Instagram [LINK]. For an elimination to be official, the assassins must not have broken any other rules in the process and have easily verifiable proof that the target was caught. Official eliminations will be posted publicly on Instagram [LINK]. A team’s failure to eliminate a member of their target team in a given week will result in their own elimination. For determining a team’s standing with respect to this rule, evidence of the elimination of a target must be sent to the directors prior to 6:00 p.m., Sunday. At or very soon after this point, teams will receive their next assignment and the next week will begin.

This only applies while the student is currently clocked in and working a shift, including working outside the building (such as taking out trash or walking to a delivery driving car), although it intentionally does not apply while they are walking into or out of work before or after their shift, even if they tried to clock in from their car.</li>
                          <li>Venues where players attend athletic or other programs specifically run by Higley High School, including practices, games, performances, etc. This safety applies only to students participating or involved in the Higley program, and only during the times which they occur. Parking lots are included.</li>

                        There will be limited opportunities for eliminated players to buy back into the game, meaning they will be immediately reinstated as active players upon paying.

If a player buys back, the team that is currently assigned to hunt them will be notified.

                        Prize money accumulates in the pot when players pay the entry fee or buy back. At any time during the game, the current pot value will be public on HigleyAssassins.com [LINK]. The directors may each take a small cut of the money, not any more than [DOLLARS]. Additionally, maintenance costs for the website will be sourced from the pot money. All information on monetary history will always be public on HigleyAssassins.com. The remaining money is then delivered to the winning team at their convenience. In the case of all remaining teams simultaneously being eliminated or multiple teams remaining by the end of the school year, they will all be considered the winners and the money will be equally distributed between the teams.
