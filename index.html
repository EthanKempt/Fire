              <p class="card-text">
                We wanted to make it easier to access all your Assassins
                information in one place. This website is specifically built to
                work with instagram to make the game simpler and more fun. We
                also wanted to create a way to see pot value and other
                information like how many teams are left. Most importantly, we
                created a clear ruleset so that no one is getting screwed over
                in their game. If the game hasn't started yet, you can preview
                all the pages we've made below, or if the game has started, just
                log in.
                <br />
                <br />

                This website has taken hours upon hours to build and despite our
                best efforts it's still pretty buggy. If you have any
                suggestions, feedback, or questions, email us at
                higleyassassins@gmail.com or message our Instaram

                Don't worry! You'll still get your assignments and be able to

                those without instagram to play and, more importantly, make sure
                all the games information is made public. Basically if your set
                on using instagram, you can still play, you just miss out on the
                benfiits of the website.

                <br />
                Whenever you get out your targets, you'll still post the video
                on instagram and we'll repost it. We're also currently working
                on a way to automatically sync those videos to this page so you
                have them no matter where you go.
