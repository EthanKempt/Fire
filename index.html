              <p class="card-text">
                We wanted to make it easier to access all your Assassins
                information in one place. This website is specifically built to
                work with Instagram to make the game simpler and more fun. We
                also wanted to create a way to see information like pot value
                and how many teams are left. Most importantly, we created a
                clear rule set so that no one is getting screwed over in their
                game. If the game hasn't started yet, you can preview all the
                pages we've made below. Once it has, just log in.
                <br />
                <br />

                This website has taken hours upon hours to build and despite our
                best efforts it's still somewhat buggy. If you have any
                suggestions, feedback, or questions, email us at
                higleyassassins@gmail.com or message our Instagram

                has been running, how many players + teams are left and more.

                Don't worry! You'll still get your assignments and be able to
                talk to us through Instagram. This website is just allowing for
                those without Instagram to play and, more importantly, make sure
                all the game's information is made public. Basically, if you're
                set on using Instagram, you can still play, you just miss out on
                the benefits of the website.
                <br />
                <br />
                Whenever you get your targets out, you'll still post the video
                on Instagram and we'll re-post it. We're also currently working
                on a way to automatically sync those videos to this page so you
                have them no matter where you go.

                Sign ups start the first week after break (Tuesday, January 2)

                join you must pay $10 a person and have 3-4 people to create a
                team. You team MUST pay all at once through one of two methods:

                Many people want to play assassins but don't necessarily have a
                full group to join with. This is why we are allowing students to
                pay solo or in a pair and we'll put you on a team of other
                soloists. After the game starts there will be no difference
                between a soloist team and a normal team. If you are interested
                in joining this way, just pay by yourself or with one other
                person and in place of your team name, just write 'Single' or
                'Double'. Make sure to provide your Instagram as this is our
                only way of communicating with you.<br /><br />
                If you are a soloist you will not be placed on a team of 3. If
                you join as a soloist/duo and don't like your team, we
                unfortunately can't give you a refund. After your team is made,
                we'll put you in contact with your team members through
                Instagram.
